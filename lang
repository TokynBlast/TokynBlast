I primarily use C++23.
The langauges doesn't mean I can make anything using it from scratch.
Some, I learned a bit for the sole purpose of making a single project,
and just haven't used it since.
One example of that, is Java.

I mainly use Python for scripts.
Specifically, a script for writing code that has a patrern.
EX:
push("hey", 1);
This line, I need to do every possible combo of upper and lower, increasing the number by one as I go.

'''
possible = (2**3)-3 # 2^3 is the max number of combos possible, subtracting one to adjust for 0 being the start in memory and the two already in text
text = "hey"
out = ["hey", "HEY"]
for i in range(possible):
  out.append(text[i].upper())

for i in range(out):
  print("print(" + out[i] + ",", i+1 + ")"
'''

(I would use a function in the code to do this, instead of making a script to write every line)
